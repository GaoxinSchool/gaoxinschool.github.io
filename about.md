Gaoxin Alumni Network is a platform dedicated to fostering resource connections and exchanges among alumni. Our primary goal is to facilitate interaction and collaboration in various forms, enabling alumni to learn from and grow with each other in their respective fields. We regularly organize lectures and presentations, inviting experienced alumni from diverse industries such as finance, project management, technological innovation, market channels, and industrial policy to share their professional knowledge and practical experiences.

<br>

Through these activities, alumni can not only broaden their horizons and stay updated with the latest industry trends but also build a robust network of relationships, promoting the connection and sharing of various resources. Whether seeking business opportunities, career guidance, or the latest developments in different fields, our association is committed to providing support and assistance to each member.

高新校友网络是一个旨在促进校友之间资源对接与交流的平台。我们的主要目标是通过多种形式的互动和合作，帮助校友们在各自的领域中互相学习和成长。我们定期举办讲座和演示活动，邀请在金融、项目管理、科技创新、市场渠道、产业政策等各行各业具有丰富经验的校友分享他们的专业知识和实践经验。
